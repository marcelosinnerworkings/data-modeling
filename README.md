# Data modeling artifacts

## What is it?

To sum up, this repository contains data modeling stuff: diagrams, SQL scripts, and other files that might be useful in the creation or restoration of databases. 

## Why?

Saving SQL DDL scripts and data modeling files that provide a high-level vision of databases is particularly useful - not only for obvious backup reasons, but also to use them as a blueprint/template for new databases and business needs.

## What is the tech stack?

The stack comprises:

* SQL
* DB Designer (https://www.dbdesigner.net/)
